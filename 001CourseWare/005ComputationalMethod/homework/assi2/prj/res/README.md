# Add here a title for the project

## High-level Description of the project
This assignment builds on Assignment I. We assume that we have successfully detected the clicks and we are applying different interpolation methods to restore the audio, such as
- median filtering
- cubic splines

## Installation and Execution

Provide details on the Python version and libraries (e.g. numpy version) you are using. One easy way to do it is to do that automatically:
```sh                                 
pip3 install pipreqs

pipreqs $project/path/requirements.txt
```
For more details check [here](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs)


Afer installing all required packages you can run the demo file simply by typing:
```sh
python demo_audio_restoration.py
```

## Methodology and Results
Describe here how you have designed your code, e.g. a main script/routine that calls different functions, is the unittesting included in the main routine? 



**Results**

1. For the median filter, different lengths were explored to test the effectiveness of the restoration. In particular, XXXX were tested and XXX was observed to deliver the lowest MSE, as shown in the figure below.

The restored waveform <output_medianFilter.wav> with the optimal filter length is given below:



2. Using the cubic splines, we observe ....

The restored waveform <output_cubicSplines.wav> with the optimal filter length is given below:


3. Comparing the two different interpolation methods, we notice that method X achieves a lower MSE. The runtime of XX method is .....

After listening to the two restored files, we notice ...
